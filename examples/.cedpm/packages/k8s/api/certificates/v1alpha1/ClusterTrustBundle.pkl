/// ClusterTrustBundle is a cluster-scoped container for X.509 trust anchors (root certificates).
///
/// 
/// ClusterTrustBundle objects are considered to be readable by any authenticated user in the cluster, because they can be mounted by pods using the `clusterTrustBundle` projection.
/// All service accounts have read access to ClusterTrustBundles by default.
/// Users who only have namespace-level access to a cluster can read ClusterTrustBundles by impersonating a serviceaccount that they have access to.
/// 
/// It can be optionally associated with a particular assigner, in which case it contains one valid set of trust anchors for that signer.
/// Signers may have multiple associated ClusterTrustBundles; each is an independent set of trust anchors for that signer.
/// Admission control is used to enforce that only users with permissions on the signer can create or modify the corresponding bundle.
