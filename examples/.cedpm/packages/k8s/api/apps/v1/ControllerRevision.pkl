/// ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data.
///
/// Clients are responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects that contain their internal state.
/// Once a ControllerRevision has been successfully created, it can not be updated.
/// The API Server will fail validation of all requests that attempt to mutate the Data field.
/// ControllerRevisions may, however, be deleted.
/// Note that, due to its use by both the DaemonSet and StatefulSet controllers for update and rollback, this object is beta.
/// However, it may be subject to name and representation changes in future releases, and clients should not depend on its stability.
/// It is primarily for internal use by controllers.
