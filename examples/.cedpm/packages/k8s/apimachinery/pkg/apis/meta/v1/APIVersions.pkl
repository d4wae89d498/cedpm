/// This is to help clients reach servers in the most network-efficient way possible.
/// Clients can use the appropriate server address as per the CIDR that they match.
/// In case of multiple matches, clients should use the longest matching CIDR.
/// The server returns only those CIDRs that it thinks that the client can match.
/// For example: the master will return an internal IP CIDR only, if the client reaches the server using an internal IP.
/// Server looks at X-Forwarded-For header or X-Real-Ip header or request.RemoteAddr (in that order) to get the client IP.
